决定了要去德国读硕士，十月份开学，离开日本大概是九月中左右。憧憬了很久的多语言博客藉这个机会也可以（应该）开始写了。

I decided to go to Germany for my Master's study. The planned departure
from Japan is around September, and the school year will start in this
October. I think this is a good opportunity to start keeping a
multilingual blog, which I should but have been too lazy to do.

这并不是一个容易的决定。在日四年，我好不容易习惯了这里的一切，找到了属于自己的生活方式和穿着风格，造好了杂乱舒适的房间，得到了一位值得毕生珍惜的好友，和可爱的男朋友。我爱上了这片冷漠又温情的土地，和她生养的民族。但是安全区令我变得迟钝，趁脑子里那个想要出去冒险的自己还没有完全沉默，再一次，我想出去看看。

This is never an easy decision. After four years in Japan, I am already
completely used to everything here. I've found my own lifestyle, built
my messy but comfort room, and met a great friend and my boyfriend who I
want to cherish for my whole life. I fell in love with this unique
country and nation that sometimes seems too cold but is always
welcoming. However, I also noticed that Japan has become pretty much a
comfort zone for me, and once more, I want to jump out of it before I
lose the soul of an adventurer.
