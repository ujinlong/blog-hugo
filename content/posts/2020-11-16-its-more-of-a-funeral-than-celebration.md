title: It's more of a funeral than celebration
---
Ok, so Biden won. Nicely done US people, or should I say, US electors?

Four years ago, since the election was called, so many university
professors and other scholars published their depressed open letters
regarding the results. The time was 2016, and I was rather naive and not
defeated by the reality back then, and decided I would wait and see what
would happen.

Then, well, shall we say, "reality" happened. My personal story on this
matter is probably more dramatic than the collective memory, but that
can wait for another time.  

I am no international relation expert, but even I can see during the
past four years that the age of rationality had gone. Dead cold gone.
The age of Trumpism would be the last time most people sing the praises
and cherish the memory of rationality. After that, finally seeing him go
and relaxed, people will forget about the importance of resisting.

This is not a warning, but a prediction. Trump has lowered the level of
politics so much so that he might as well just have single-handedly
reshaped the trend of regime development, as well as made the world more
comfortable with autocracy than before. Such a world may not affect us
immediately, but democrats sleep and take holidays while dictators
never. Every day when we are not on edge, holding tight our rationality
and resistance, the big brother takes extra miles.
